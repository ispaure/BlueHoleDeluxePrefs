# 🥷 **USING THE PIE MENUS WITHOUT DELUXE**
---
If you want to use the pie menus whilst using Blue Hole Regular (non-deluxe), you can bind keymaps to the menus by yourself.
1. Navigate to `Blender Settings`
2. Navigate to the `Keymap` Tab
3. Find the proper context for the pie menu (eg. UV Editor)
4. Add a new keymap entry
5. Just make sure to use the `wm.open_menu_pie` operator and use the `Internal Name` specified under each Pie Menu in this document as name of the pie menu.
